Data Structures and Algorithms is about solving problems efficiently. A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn't even know why their solution is inefficient. So, the question is, *How do you rank an algorithm's efficiency?*

> If you want to learn the math involved with the Big O, read  [Analysing Algorithms: Worst Case Running Time](../analysing-algorithms-worst-case-running-time).

The simple answer to that question is the **Big O Notation**. How does that work? Let me explain!

Say you wrote a function which goes through every number in a list and adds it to a *total_sum* variable.

If you consider "addition" to be 1 operation then running this function on a list of 10 numbers will cost 10 operations, running it on a list of 20 numbers costs 20 operations  and similarly running it on a list of n numbers costs the *length of list* (n) operations.

Now let's assume you wrote another function that would return the first number in a list.

Now, no matter how large this list is, this function will never cost more than one operation. Fairly, these two algorithms have different **time complexity** or *relationship between growth of input size and growth of operations executed*. We communicate these time complexities using ***Big O Notation***.

> Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Referring to the complexities as *'**n**'*, common complexities (ranked from good to bad) are:

- Constant - **O(1)**
- Logarithmic **O(log n)**
- Linear - **O(n)**
- n log n - **O(n log n)**
- Quadratic - **O(n¬≤)**
- Exponential - **O(2‚Åø)**
- Factorial - **O(n!)**

Our first algorithm runs in *O(n)*, meaning its operations grew in a linear relationship with the input size - in this case, the amount of numbers in the list. Our second algorithm is not dependent on the input size at all  - so it runs in constant time. 
Let's take a look at how many operations a program has to execute in function with an input size of *n = 5 vs n = 50*.

|                | n = 5 | n = 50           |
|----------------|-------|------------------|
| **O(1)**       | 1     | 1                |
| **O(log n)**   | 4     | 6                |
| **O(n)**       | 5     | 50               |
| **O(n log n)** | 20    | 300              |
| **O(n¬≤)**      | 25    | 2500             |
| **O(2‚Åø)**      | 32    | 1125899906842624 |
| **O(n!)**      | 120   | 3.0414093e+64    |

It might not matter when the input is small, but this gap gets very dramatic as the input size increases.

If n were 10000, a function that runs in *log(n)* would only take 14 operations and a function that runs in *n!* would set your computer on fire!

For Big O Notation, we *drop constants* so *O(10.n)* and *O(n/10)* are both equivalent to *O(n)* because the graph is still linear.

Big O Notation is also used for **space complexity**, which works the same way - *how much space an algorithm uses as n grows* or *relationship between growth of input size and growth of space needed*.

So, yeah! This has been the simplest possible explanation of the Big O Notation from my side and I hope you enjoyed reading this.
